## Deployment

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

Note: Any code committed to the "main" branch will automatically update the live site.
1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/timgoalen/identify-this-chord)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. In the left sidebar, click on "Pages" in the "Code and automation" section.
4. Under "Source", click on the dropdown menu and choose "Deploy from a branch".
5. Under "Branch", from the "Select a branch" dropdown menu choose "main"; and from the "Select a folder" dropdown menu choose "/ (root)"; then click the "Save" button in the "Branch" section.
6. Locate the now published site at the top of the "GitHub Pages" page.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/timgoalen/identify-this-chord)
2. At the top right of the Repository, just below the GitHub navbar, click on the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/timgoalen/identify-this-chord)
2. Above the list of files, click "Code".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```
